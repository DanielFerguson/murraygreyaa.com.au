   When a new registration is submitted, the administrator receives an email notification with:
   - Calf details (name, tattoo, grade, sex)

   - Sex and grade
   - Who submitted it
   - Current status (Pending/Published)

4. **Approve the Registration**  
   For pending registrations, hover over the row and click the blue **"Approve"** link. This:
   - Changes the status from "Pending" to "Published"
   - Makes the registration visible in the public Animal Search
   - Sends an email to the member confirming approval

### Step 4: Member Receives Approval

Once approved:
1. **Email Notification**  
   The member receives an email with the good news and a link to view their published registration.

2. **Dashboard Update**  
   On the member's dashboard, the registration status changes from "Pending Approval" (yellow) to **"Approved"** (green).

3. **Public Visibility**  
   The cattle registration is now:
   - Visible on the public Animal Search page
   - Accessible via its own detail page
   - Searchable by name, tattoo, breeder, sire, or dam
